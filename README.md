 Warehouse Optimization Using Clustering 

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
Efficient warehouse management is crucial for reducing operational costs and improving logistics. This project applies clustering methods to optimize warehouse layouts, streamline storage allocation, and enhance inventory management.  

By using **unsupervised machine learning techniques**, we segment inventory based on demand patterns, product categories, and storage efficiency.  

Dataset  
The dataset contains warehouse-related attributes such as:  
- Demand
- Longitude
- Latitude 

How Demand is Calculated
Demand in warehouse optimization is typically calculated based on historical sales data, order frequency, and seasonal trends. Common methods include:

Simple Moving Average (SMA): Averages past sales over a set period.
Exponential Smoothing: Assigns more weight to recent sales data.
Demand Forecasting Models: Uses regression, time series analysis, or ML models to predict future demand.




 Machine Learning Approach  
We applied clustering algorithms to optimize warehouse operations:  

âœ… K-Means Clustering â€“ Grouping similar inventory items  
âœ… Hierarchical Clustering â€“ Understanding product relationships  
âœ… DBSCAN â€“ Detecting anomalies in stock movements  

 Evaluation Metrics  
To validate clustering effectiveness, we used:  
- Silhouette Score â€“ Measures clustering quality  
- Inertia (Within-Cluster SSE) â€“ Evaluates compactness  
- Davies-Bouldin Index â€“ Assesses cluster separation  

Key Insights  
ðŸ“Œ K-Means clustering provided optimal warehouse segmentation  
ðŸ“Œ High-demand items were moved to easily accessible zones  
ðŸ“Œ Anomaly detection identified slow-moving or misplaced stock  

Future Improvements
- Test with additional clustering techniques (Gaussian Mixture, Agglomerative Clustering)
- Integrate real-time warehouse tracking data
